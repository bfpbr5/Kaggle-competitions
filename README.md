## Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses a neural network model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The model is implemented in Python using the PyTorch library.

### Directory Structure

- `Titanic/`: Main project directory.
  - `titanic.py`: Python script that implements the model.
  - `train.csv`: Training dataset with passenger features and survival status.
  - `test.csv`: Testing dataset with passenger features.
  - `data/`: Directory intended for additional data (currently empty).

### How to Run

1. Ensure that you have the necessary Python libraries installed. These include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and PyTorch.
2. Run the `titanic.py` script. This will train the model, evaluate it, and save the predictions to a CSV file.
